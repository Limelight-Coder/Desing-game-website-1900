     <span style="color:white ;"> &nbsp;<b>Guards</b> &nbsp;<br><br>1) To avoid fighting the guards, you can easily bypass them by moving toward them and therefore swapping them into the other side, now put your sword down and run.&nbsp;<br> Unlike PoP2, in PoP1 it's impossible to fight more than one guard at a time.&nbsp;<br><br> 2) Make the person your fighting make the first move, block it and counter attack.&nbsp;<br>But if you make the first move he blocks and counter attacks you and so on and eventually you get wounded cause you don't block in time especially with Jaffar.&nbsp;<br></br>3)There is a little trick to fight against the guards which don't move: when you are in front of the guard, put down the sword... &nbsp;<br>now that you are without sword the guard will get near you... you soon have to clasp the sword again and you'll hit the guard easily; do this for n times, where n is the number of lives of the guard!</span>

         <span style="color:white  ;"> &nbsp;<b>Floor tiles</b> &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Did you know that you can avoid losing a life when letting the loose floor fall on you? Just crouch in the right time (needs a really good timing), but after practicing a bit you can &nbsp;save a few lives. Anyway, it looks like a bug of the game ;)
<br><br>&nbsp;
            2) other simple mindless tricks with the floor tiles:
<br><br>&nbsp;            
            1.after you knock a loose tile in the ceiling and have no place to go you can avoid being hit by sitting in the right place(standing up)-the tile will fall on you but won't hurt you. &nbsp;&nbsp;From what I've seen this only happens in the mirror level at one point shortly after starting the level.
<br><br>&nbsp;           
            2.This one's not actually a trick, it's a no-brainer: standing one story higher than a guard and killing him by knocking a loose tile on his head.
